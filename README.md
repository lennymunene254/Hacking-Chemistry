# Hacking-Chemistry
Really sucked at writing chemical equations, leave alone balancing. Just trying to see if it's possible too have a program do it for me
The program is designed to read user input and read from a predefined equations list. 
It works on some computers and crashes in some.
Looking forward to constructive debugging.
